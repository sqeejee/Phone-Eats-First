The idea! Phone eats first, the app that makes food a true social (media) experience.

The problem. Picture this: It's saturday night and the whole squad is coming over for a great night. There's old relible, a pizza for the group, but that is getting a little tired. You could go read reveiws on yelp, but old women complaining about wait staff clouds your vision of a good meal. If only there was a place to see resturants for their food and make sure your friends want it too....


Functionality:
-Users will be able to snap pictures of meals they have out of the house
-Attached to the picture, they can leave a numerical and optional written review
-After posting, the user has their review added to a map of all restaurants they've gone to!
-The user's friends can see the map as well, and get insight into great (or bad) places near them!

Pages/Interactions:
  -Home page:
      - See recent reviews
      - Recommendations of restaurants near you
      - A map of places with public reviews/friend reviews near you.
  -Profile Pages
      - See a user's reviews and see where they've eaten on a map
      - Users can "pin" (or fork cause food lol) glowing recommendations and must haves to their profile.
      - Standard profile picture, bio, etc.
  
  Value/Reasons to use:
  -Its hard to decide what to eat, now I know what's good near me, and can see what people think about it
  -Makes it easier to find what your friends like
  -Can interact with food lovers in your area!
