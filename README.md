# The idea
The idea! Phone eats first, the app that makes food a true social (media) experience.


# The problem. 
Picture this: It's saturday night and the whole squad is coming over for a great night. There's old relible, a pizza for the group, but that is getting a little tired. You could go read reveiws on yelp, but old women complaining about wait staff clouds your vision of a good meal. If only there was a place to see resturants for their food and make sure your friends want it too....


# Functionality:
-Users will be able to snap pictures of meals they have out of the house
-Attached to the picture, they can leave a numerical and optional written review
-After posting, the user has their review added to a map of all restaurants they've gone to!
-The user's friends can see the map as well, and get insight into great (or bad) places near them!
-Customized Dietary Preferences
    - Allow users to set dietary preferences (e.g., vegetarian, vegan, gluten-free) in their profile.
    Implement a filter option for users to find reviews and recommendations that match their dietary preferences.
    Provide badges

# Pages/Interactions:
  -Home page:
      - See recent reviews
      - Recommendations of restaurants near you
      - A map of places with public reviews/friend reviews near you.
  -Profile Pages
      - See a user's reviews and see where they've eaten on a map
      - Users can "pin" (or fork cause food lol) glowing recommendations and must haves to their profile.
      - Standard profile picture, bio, etc.
  
  # Value/Reasons to use:
  -Its hard to decide what to eat, now I know what's good near me, and can see what people think about it
  -Makes it easier to find what your friends like
  -Can interact with food lovers in your area!

# UI/UX
-Users create accounts, and are immediately greeted with a map of good places in their area
-They can add reviews or they can look at others/find their friends
-Every review MUST have a picture attached of the food they ordered at the place 
-The user can either create a post, look for friends, or look at popular recommendations
-The user will get notifications whenever one of their friends posts a new review
-If the user goes on the app at lunch/dinner times (11am-3pm or 5:30pm-8:30pm), they will be served recommendations first, as they are likely looking for a place to eat
-Users can like and comment on others reviews
-Reviews are either between friends or public
-You can only view a persons eating history/location data if you are friends or the user has opted to let it be public 

# Repition Behavior
-Doom scrolling possible
-People are very motivated by hunger, it is one of the core evolutionary wants in our brains. people could end up scrolling looking at food for hours
  -This is potentially bad as social media today often leads to people feeling insecure about their food
    -Can act as a positivity platform? People will be more engaged to share and be happy about their food, could lead to this being seen as a public good


# Scalability
-This could be a major app dedicated to food
-Could expand to include recipes and tutorials for eating at home
-Restaurants could allow for ordering through the app
-Restaurants may want to advertise and get their reviews/stores seen
