More ideas:

Realitive ratings, ratings for users only make sense compared to their ratings of other restaurants
Ask users what they think of SUPER popular places like McDonalds or inNOut or Chickfila to get a baseline of their opinions.

Lean in heavy on that map.

Rings around reviews at locations, circle around ring is based on how positive the score was
The rings fade over time to show how recent a review is.

Add ordering food and taking payements.
Affilate doordash links?

Money initially.
Premium options for users, taking away ads from them once they buy
Give paid users MORE functionality.
